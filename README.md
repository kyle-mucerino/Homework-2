I wanted to create a simple profile that displays three sections with information about me and my skills, a link to my resume, as well as a contact page for ways to get in touch.I started with a <h1> header that is simply my name.
I created a navigation bar that includes an unordered list where you can click to go to the respective sections of the page. ('about me', 'resume', 'contact')
The main content of the page was split into three sections: 'About Me' , 'Resume' , and 'Contact'.
The 'About Me' section was given a class of "main" and contains an image of myself as well as a paragraph describing the skills I have for jobs I will be applying for.
The 'Resume' section was given a class of "float-right" and contains a placeholder image of a resume stock photo as well as a caption for the image that will be a clickable link to my resume. 
The 'Contact' section was given a class of "float-left" and contains a >h1> header , and two paragraph elements that show my email and phone number. I also inserted a clickable link to my LinkedIn profile. 
I styled the entire page to have a background of pink with a margin and padding of 0. The header and nav bar were given flex and flexbox display tags so they would be able to be viewed normally on any kind of web browser. Each of the sections of content were styled the same. Given a border of black all around with the images and information given inside the boxes.
